Code implementations for Labs in Advanced Applied Machine Learning. 

## Description

- Bayesian Optimisation: Design of kernel matrix and implementation of Bayesion Optimisation algorithm for an ANN. Compares accuracy and loss of random search and grid search to evaluate utility. 
- CNN Classification: Comparative tests of CNNs designed from scratch and pretrained CNNs with transfer-learning. Uses F1-Score, loss and accuracy to evaluate performance.
- NLP Word Form Prediction: Prediction of word forms with RNN and LSTM-models. Utilised predefined embeddings in combination with randomised embedding vectors for classification on custom dataset. Uses Chunker Score to evaluate performance.
- Reinforcement Learning: Implemented policy training for RL blackjack model. Utilises OpenAI's gym to test model performance.
