Code implementations for Labs in Advanced Applied Machine Learning. 

## Description

- Bayesian Optimisation: Design of kernel matrix and subsequent implementation of Bayesion Optimisation for an ANN.
- CNN Classification: Comparative tests of CNNs designed from scratch and pretrained CNNs with transfer-learning. 
- NLP Word Form Prediction: Prediction of word forms with RNN and LSTM-models. Utilised predefined embeddings in combination with randomised embedding vectors for classification on custom dataset.
- Reinforcement Learning:
